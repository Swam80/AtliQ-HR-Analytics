*  Sick Leave (SL) Percentage: The sick leave percentage stands at a commendable 1.10%, indicating a culture of strong attendance and minimal sick leave instances among employees. 

*  Day of the Week and Presence Percentage: Analyzing presence percentages by day of the week reveals interesting patterns: Fridays show a slightly lower presence percentage of 90.19% compared to other weekdays. Mondays witness a high presence percentage of 93.21%, signaling a positive start to the workweek. Saturdays and Sundays have a 0.00% presence percentage, as weekends are non-working days. Thursdays and Wednesdays demonstrate presence percentages of 90.72% and 92.11% respectively, indicating consistent attendance mid-week. Tuesdays mirror Mondays, with a presence percentage of 93.03%. 

## Insights and Recommendations: 
Based on the data analysis, the following insights and recommendations can guide effective decision-making: 

* Office Space Utilization: 
Leverage higher attendance rates on Mondays and Tuesdays to plan team-building exercises and essential meetings that require maximum employee presence. This approach optimizes office space utilization and fosters collaboration. 

* Maintenance and Off-Peak Activities: 
Utilize Fridays and Thursdays, which exhibit slightly lower attendance rates, to focus on office maintenance and organize activities that require fewer employees. This strategy ensures efficient space management without disrupting regular work. 

* Work-from-Home (WFH) Policy: 
Considering the 10% preference for remote work, implementing or strengthening a work-from-home policy can offer employees flexibility and contribute to overall satisfaction and work-life balance. 

* Wellness Programs: 
While the low sick leave percentage indicates good employee health, introducing wellness programs and initiatives can further nurture a healthy work environment, reduce sick leave instances, and promote employee well-being. 

## Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the insightful data analysis empowers Atliq Technologies to optimize office space utilization, foster employee engagement, and enhance work-life balance. By leveraging these findings, the company can make informed decisions regarding team activities, maintenance schedules, work-from-home policies, and wellness programs. These measures will ultimately lead to a more productive and satisfied workforce.
